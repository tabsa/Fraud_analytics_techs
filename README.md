This repository implements all important steps of ML modelling to make a multi-class classifier. Here, we pretend to classify nine rock types through the measurement of their physical properties. The open-access dataset comes from Hugoton and Panoma Fields in North America which was used as class exercise at The University of Kansas (Dubois et. al, 2007).

This project follows the steps explained of the tutorial from Ryan A. Mardani ([link here](https://towardsdatascience.com/practical-machine-learning-tutorial-part-1-data-exploratory-analysis-c13d39b8f33b)).
